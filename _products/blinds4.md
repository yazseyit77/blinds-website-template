  Everyone loves a house with great curb appeal and the value it adds to a home. There's more to it than lovely landscaping and pretty paint, though. Design details like your windows can have a traffic-stopping impact on the overall impression the exterior of your home makes. To give hers more appeal, Debbie G. from Salisbury, North Carolina, chose these 2" Select American Hardwood Blinds. 



  Classic horizontal wood blind controls light and privacy.
